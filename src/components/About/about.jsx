              Predict is designed for women who have undergone surgery for early
              invasive breast cancer. It assists them in determining which
              additional treatments may enhance their survival rates.
              Additionally, it is beneficial for healthcare professionals
              seeking AI-assisted insights and researchers exploring medical
              machine learning applications.

            <h2>How Predict Works?</h2>
            <p>
              Predict utilizes <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> to analyze
              patient data and estimate breast cancer survival rates over time.
              This supervised machine learning algorithm is particularly
              effective for binary classification problems, such as predicting
              cancer outcomes.
            </p>

            <br/>

            <p>
              The algorithm considers multiple features from a patientâ€™s medical
              data, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Tumor Size and Shape:</strong> Radius, perimeter, and
                area measurements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Texture and Smoothness:</strong> Variations in tissue
                appearance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Compactness, Concavity, and Symmetry:</strong>{" "}
                Characteristics of tumor cell growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lymph Node Involvement:</strong> Spread of cancer to
                nearby lymph nodes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hormone Receptor Status:</strong> Presence of receptors
                like ER (Estrogen Receptor) and HER2.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Using these inputs, the model applies a mathematical function to
              calculate the probability of survival based on historical data
              from thousands of similar cases.
            </p>

            <br/>

            <h3>Why Logistic Regression?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ideal for predicting binary outcomes like survival
                probabilities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provides clear probability scores for easy interpretation by
                doctors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Handles multiple independent variables for accurate predictions.
              </li>
            </ul>


            <p>
              Predict provides estimated survival rates at different time
              intervals (e.g., 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years) along with the
              expected benefits of additional treatments. However, final
              decisions should always be made in consultation with healthcare
              professionals.
